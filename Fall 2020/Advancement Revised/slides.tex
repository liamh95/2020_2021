	\begin{frame}{Basic Definitions}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A \textbf{graph} $G = (V, E)$ consists of a (finite for us) set of \textbf{vertices} $V$ and a set $E$ of edges where $E\subseteq \binom{V}{2}$.

			\pause

			\item The number of vertices incident to $v\in V$ is its \textbf{degree}, $d_G(v)$.
			We let $\Delta(G)$ and $\delta(G)$ denote the maximum and minimum degree, respectively.

			\pause

			\item $H = (V', E')$ is a \textbf{subgraph} of $G$ if $V'\subseteq V$, $E'\subseteq E$ and each edge in $E'$ has both ends in $V'$.

			\pause

			%%\item $H = (V', E')$ is a \textbf{spanning subgraph} of $G = (V, E)$ if $V' = V$.\pause

			\item If $X\subseteq V$, then the \textbf{subgraph induced by $X$}, $G[X]$, is the graph with vertex set $X$ and all edges from $E$ that have both ends in $X$.


			%\item The \textbf{degree} of a vertex $v$, denoted $d_G(v)$, is the number of edges of $G$ that $v$ appears in. We let $\delta(G)$ denote the minimum degree of any of $G$'s vertices and $\Delta(G)$ the maximum.

	\begin{frame}{Guaranteeing the existence of a subgraph}
		\begin{itemize}

			\begin{theorem}[W. Mantel - 1907]
				If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with more than $\lfloor n/2\rfloor \lceil n/2 \rceil$ edges, then $G$ contains a triangle.
			\end{theorem}

			\pause

			\item The graph on $n$ vertices with all possible edges is called the \textbf{complete graph} and is denoted $K_n$.

			\pause

			\begin{theorem}[P. Tur\'an - 1941]
				If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with more than $(1-\frac{1}{r})\frac{n^2}{2}$ edges, then $G$ contains a copy of $K_{r+1}$.
			\end{theorem}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}


	\begin{frame}{What about other graphs?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Given a graph $H$, the \textbf{extremal number} (or \textbf{Tur\'an number}) $\text{ex}(n, H)$ is the largest number of edges in an $H$-free graph on $n$ vertices.

			\pause

			\begin{theorem}[P. Erd\H{os}, A. Stone - 1946]
				Let $H$ be a nonempty graph and let $r$ be the \textbf{chromatic number} of $H$ (the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of $H$ so that no two adjacent vertices are of the same color). Then
				\[
					\text{ex}(n, H) = \left(1-\frac{1}{r-1}\right)\binom{n}{2} + o(n^2).
				\]
			\end{theorem}

			% \pause

			% \item Problems related to embedding subgraphs based on the number of edges in the host graph are called \textbf{Tur\'an-type problems}.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}


	\begin{frame}{What about other graphs?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Apparently, the case of a \textbf{bipartite graph} (one whose chromatic number is 2) is exceptional.
			We only know the correct order of magnitude for such graphs in specific cases.

			\pause

			\item If $T$ is a \textbf{tree} (a graph which contains no cycles), then $\text{ex}(n, T) = \Theta(n)$.

			\pause

			\item Erd\H{os} showed that $\text{ex}(n, C_{2k})  = O(n^{1 + 1/k})$ for even cycles $C_{2k}$.
			Matching lower bounds are only known for $C_4$, $C_6$ and $C_{10}$.

	\begin{frame}{Larger substructures}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Suppose we have 16 sports teams.
			Due to travel restrictions, some teams cannot play each other.
			How many pairs of teams that can play each other do we need to ensure that we can pair off all teams?

			\pause

			\item If even one team is unable to play with all the other teams, it can't be done.

			\pause

			\item Say we have a network of cities and roads between them.
			We have important deliveries to make in each city and we need to come back to where we started at the end of the day.
			How many roads do we need to guarantee that we need to visit each city only once?

			\pause

			\item We can't do this if there's only one road into any particular city.
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{frame}{Larger substructures}
		\begin{definition}
			Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph.
			A subset of edges $\mathcal{M}\subseteq E$ is called a \textbf{matching} if its edges are vertex-disjoint.
			The matching $\mathcal{M}$ is \textbf{perfect} if the vertices that comprise it cover all of $V$.
		\end{definition}

		\pause

		\begin{definition}
			Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a sequence of edges.
			Then $\mathcal{C}$ is a \textbf{Hamiltonian cycle} if it is a cycle that visits every vertex in $G$ exactly once.
		\end{definition}

		% \begin{definition}
		% 	Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a sequence of edges.
		% 	Then $\mathcal{C}$ is a...

	\begin{frame}{Another perspective}
		\begin{itemize}

			\item How many edges do we need to force a perfect matching or Hamiltonian cycle?

			\pause

			\item This question is a bit different from asking about $\text{ex}(n, H)$ for some $H$ since now our subgraph isn't fixed - it depends on $n$.

			\pause

			\item The Tur\'an perspective doesn't tell us much about perfect matchings - start with $K_n$ and delete all edges incident to one fixed vertex.
			The resulting graph has no perfect matching.

			\pause

			\begin{theorem}[P. Hall - 1935]
				Let $G$ be a bipartite graph with parts $X$ and $Y$ (all edges in $G$ have one end in $X$ and one end in $Y$).
				Then $G$ contains a matching that saturates $X$ if and only if every subset $W$ of $X$ has at least $|W|$ neighbors in $Y$.
			\end{theorem}	

		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{Another perspective}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Similarly, if any vertex has degree less than 2, we cannot have a Hamiltonian cycle.

			\pause

			\begin{theorem}[G. Dirac - 1952]
				A graph on $n\geq 3$ vertices contains a Hamiltonian cycle if $\delta(G)\geq n/2$ (graphs with such minimum degree are called \textbf{Dirac graphs}). In particular, such a graph contains a perfect matching if $n$ is even.
			\end{theorem}

			\pause

			\item Apparently, some structures aren't simply related to the number of edges in the host graph, but how they're distributed.
			
			\pause
			
			\item Graph embedding problems relating to the degree of the host graph are called \textbf{Dirac-type problems}.

\section{Counting perfect matchings and Hamiltonian cycles}
	

	\begin{frame}{From one to many}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item If a graph has sufficiently high minimum degree, it contains a Hamiltonian cycle (and a perfect matching if there is an even number of vertices).
			Could it have many?

			\pause

			\item The \textbf{Erd\H{o}s-Renyi random graph}, $\mathcal{G}(n, p)$, is the random variable that outputs a graph on $n$ vertices, any two of which are independently connected with probability $p$.
			It's one of the most well-studied random structures.

			% \pause
			
			% \item Say we're interested in some graph property, e.g. "has a Hamiltonian cycle."
			% Does there exist some value of $p$ for which $G\sim \mathcal{G}(n, p)$ has this property with high probability (whp)?

			% \pause

			% \item A function $r(n)$ is a \textbf{threshold function} for some property $P$ if whenever $p = o(r(n))$, $G\sim \mathcal{G}(n, p)$ does not satisfy $P$ whp, and whenever $p = \omega(r(n))$, $G$ satisfies $P$ whp.


			% \item If $G\sim \mathcal{G}(n, p)$, then 
			% \begin{align*}
			% 	\E[\#\{\text{perfect matchings in }G\}] &= \frac{n!}{2^{n/2}(n/2)!}p^{n/2},\\
			% 	\E[\#\{\text{Hamiltonian cycles in }G\}] &= \frac{1}{2}(n-1)!p^n.
			% \end{align*}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}


	% \begin{frame}{Random graphs}
	% 	\begin{itemize}
	% 		\begin{theorem}[B. Bollob\'as, A. Thomason - 1987]
	% 			If $P$ is a monotone property (adding edges doesn't violate it), then $P$ has a threshold function (e.g. $\frac{\log n}{n}$ for connectivity and $\frac{\log n + \log\log n}{n}$ for Hamiltonicity). 
	% 		\end{theorem}

	% 		\pause

	% 		\item Random Tur\'an-like questions: threshold for containing some graph $H$ as a subgraph?
	% 		``Contains $H$'' is a monotone property.

	% 		\pause

	% 		\item Example: $G\sim \mathcal{G}(n, p)$ contains a triangle whp if $p = \frac{d}{n}$ for $d > \sqrt[3]{6}$ and it doesn't if $d<\sqrt[3]{6}$.

	% 	\end{itemize}
	% \end{frame}


	\begin{frame}{From one to many - intuition from random graphs}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Idea: if $p>1/2$, then $G\sim \mathcal{G}(n,p)$ is Dirac whp.
			Maybe we can use probabilistic tools to estimate the number of perfect matchings/Hamiltonian cycles in $G$.
			Does this tell us anything about deterministic Dirac graphs?

			\pause

			\item Expected number of perfect matchings ($n$ even): $\frac{n!}{2^{n/2}(n/2)!}p^{n/2}$.

			\pause

			\item Expected number of Hamiltonian cycles: $\frac{1}{2}(n-1)!p^n$.

			\pause

			\item By Markov's inequality, $G\sim \mathcal{G}(n,p)$ doesn't have ``too many'' Hamiltonian cycles (perfect matchings) whp.

			\pause

			\item Glebov and Krivelevich showed that if $p = \frac{\log n + \log \log n + \omega(1)}{n}$, then the number of Hamiltonian cycles in $G\sim \mathcal{G}(n,p)$, up to a sub-exponential factor, concentrates about its mean.



			% \pause

			% \item Dirac graphs contain, up to a subexponential factor, at least as many Hamiltonian cycles (perfect matchings) as one would expect from the random graph.
		\end{itemize}	
	\end{frame}


	\begin{frame}{From one to many - intuition from random graphs}
		\begin{itemize}
			\begin{theorem}[B. Cuckler, J. Kahn - 2009]
				If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with $\delta(G) \geq n/2$, then
				\begin{align*}
					\#\{\text{perfect matchings in }G\} &\geq (1-o(1))^n\cdot \frac{n!}{2^n(n/2)!}\\
					\#\{\text{Hamiltonian cycles in }G\} &\geq (1-o(1))^n\cdot \frac{1}{2^n}(n-1)!
				\end{align*}
			\end{theorem}

			\pause

			\item Edge disjoint cycles? Covering? Directed graphs?

		\end{itemize}	
	\end{frame}


	\begin{frame}{A riddle}
		\begin{itemize}
			\begin{problem}[T. Kirkman - 1850] %Lady's and Gentleman's Diary
				Fifteen young ladies in a school walk out three abreast seven days in succession: it is required to arrange them daily so that no two shall walk twice abreast.
			\end{problem}

			\pause

			\item Consider the set of ladies $H$ and let $E$ be the collection of subsets of $H$ of the form $\{\ell_1, \ell_2, \ell_3\}$, where the ladies $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$ walk together on some day.

			\pause

			\item Sounds like a graph, except edges are triples!

			\pause 

			\item Kirkman's problem is asking us to find something resembling a collection of perfect matchings.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}


	\begin{frame}{A generalization - hypergraphs}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A \textbf{hypergraph} $H = (V, E)$ consists of a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E\subseteq 2^V$.
			We say that $H$ is $k$-uniform if every edge consists of exactly $k$ vertices (note that a graph is a 2-uniform hypergraph).

			\pause

			\item We can talk about Tur\'an or Dirac-type problems in this setting too.

			\pause

			\item More generalized notion of degree: if $S$ is any subset, then $d(S)$ is the number of edges that contain $S$.
			$\delta_t(H)$ is the minimum of $d(S)$ over all subsets of size $t$.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}


	\begin{frame}{Generalizing the substructures}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Can we extend the notions of matchings and cycles to hypergraphs?

			\pause

			\item Matchings seem fine.

			\pause

			\item Cycles are a bit less clear since the edges in graph cycles overlap at the ends.
			How can we account for this in hypergraphs?

			\pause

			\item We say that a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ contains a \textbf{Hamiltonian $\ell$-cycle} if there is a cyclic ordering of the vertices of $H$ such that the edges of the cycle are segments of length $k$ in this ordering and any two consecutive edges $f_i$, $f_{i+1}$ share exactly $\ell$ vertices.

	\begin{frame}{Matchings and cycles in hypergraphs}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Notice that if $\ell = 0$, then a Hamiltonian $\ell$-cycle is a perfect matching.

			\pause 
			
			\item If $\ell > k/2$, \emph{three} consecutive edges in an $\ell$-cycle overlap.
			This ostensibly makes counting these more nuanced.

			\pause

			\item For $\ell \leq k/2$, the number of Hamiltonian $\ell$-cycles we expect to see in a random hypergraph with edge probability $p$ is
			\[
				(n-1)!\cdot \frac{k-\ell}{2}\cdot \left(\frac{p}{\ell!(k-2\ell)!}\right)^{\frac{n}{k-\ell}}.
